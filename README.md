# AngularCodemindTask
 
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to extend my sincere apologies for the delayed submission of my assignment. Unfortunately, I encountered an unexpected issue related to the Firebase version compatibility with Angular, which regrettably led to the delay in submitting my work.

I was not aware of the specific Firebase version that is compatible with Angular, and this lack of knowledge caused the assignment submission to be postponed. I took some extra time to research and resolve the compatibility issue to ensure the assignment is submitted correctly.

I understand that this delay may have caused inconvenience, and for that, I sincerely apologize. I assure you that I take my  responsibilities seriously and will make every effort to prevent such delays in the future.

Thank you for your understanding and patience in this matter.

Best regards,

Pratiksha Mahajan
